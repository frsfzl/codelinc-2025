# VAPI Setup Guide

This document explains the basic VAPI integration for the AI Voice Avatar app.

## What's Implemented

### 1. VAPI Service (`services/vapi.ts`)
- **REST API Implementation**: Uses VAPI's REST API directly (React Native compatible)
- Basic VAPI client setup with your API key
- Assistant creation with simple prompt
- Voice call management (start/end calls)
- Support for both inbound and outbound calls

### 2. Voice Interaction UI (`components/voice-interaction.tsx`)
- Simple UI to start voice calls
- Option to make outbound calls to phone numbers
- Call status display
- Basic error handling

### 3. Integration
- Added to the main home screen
- Ready for testing on mobile devices

## How to Test

1. **Start the app**: Run `npm start` and open on your mobile device using Expo Go
2. **Start a call**: Tap "Start Voice Call" to begin a conversation
3. **Make outbound call**: Enter a phone number and tap "Call Phone Number"
4. **End call**: Tap "End Call" to terminate the conversation

## Current Configuration

- **Implementation**: REST API (React Native compatible)
- **Model**: GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Voice Provider**: 11labs (default voice)
- **Transcriber**: Deepgram
- **Max Call Duration**: 5 minutes
- **Basic Prompt**: "You are a helpful AI assistant..."

## Next Steps

This is a basic implementation. Future enhancements could include:
- RAG integration with PDF knowledge base
- Custom voice models
- Call recording and analytics
- Advanced conversation flows
- Integration with external tools

## API Key

Your VAPI API key is configured in `services/vapi.ts`. Make sure to keep this secure and never commit it to version control in production.
